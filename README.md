# Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of 12 fundamental algorithms in C, all designed to take user input. These algorithms cover sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, backtracking, and computational geometry.

## üìå List of Algorithms

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sorting Algorithms
- **Insertion Sort** ‚Äì Sorts an array by inserting elements into their correct position.
- **Bubble Sort** ‚Äì Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements to sort the array.
- **Merge Sort** ‚Äì Uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array.
- **Quick Sort** ‚Äì Picks a pivot and partitions the array for efficient sorting.
- **Randomized Quick Sort** ‚Äì Uses a randomly selected pivot for improved performance.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search** ‚Äì Sequentially checks each element until a match is found.
- **Binary Search** ‚Äì Efficiently searches a sorted array by dividing it into halves.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Matrix & Geometric Algorithms
- **Strassen Matrix Multiplication** ‚Äì Optimized method for matrix multiplication.
- **Convex Hull (Graham‚Äôs Scan Algorithm)** ‚Äì Finds the smallest convex boundary for a set of points.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Greedy & Dynamic Programming
- **Huffman Coding** ‚Äì Greedy algorithm for lossless data compression.
- **Knapsack Problem (Greedy Approach)** ‚Äì Selects items based on value-to-weight ratio.
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** ‚Äì Finds the longest subsequence appearing in two strings.
- **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP - Dynamic Programming)** ‚Äì Finds the shortest route visiting all cities once.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Backtracking & String Matching
- **N-Queen‚Äôs Problem** ‚Äì Places N queens on a chessboard so no two attack each other.
- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) String Matching** ‚Äì Efficiently searches for a pattern in a given text.
